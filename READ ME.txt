Open up the Greedy Tracker and select your Puzzle Pirates game chatlog location. 
It will remember this file forever unless you delete config.txt.
It will display the last 10 minutes (Basically the most recently opened ones)
7 days , 30, days, 90 days, and All time.

This will only display as far back as your chat log goes... so date you set the option to start one in game.

Enjoy Tracking your Poe Won off greedy purses :P
